# Business Value and ROI: Industry Perspectives

Media Mix Modeling (MMM) delivers significant business value across industries. Let's examine how retail, CPG, and insurance companies are leveraging MMM to drive measurable results, with real-world case studies and ROI metrics.

## Retail Industry Applications and Case Studies

Retail organizations face unique challenges in marketing measurement: complex customer journeys, competitive promotions, and the interplay between online and offline channels. MMM helps address these challenges by providing a holistic view of marketing effectiveness.

### Case Study: Multinational Retail Banking

A multinational retail banking company implemented MMM to optimize its marketing budget allocation across channels. According to a Quantzig case study, the bank was struggling to determine the effectiveness of its marketing inputs and allocate its budget efficiently.

The implementation examined relationships between marketing mix elements and performance measures like sales and market share. By applying statistical analysis to historical marketing and performance data, the bank gained insights into which channels and tactics were driving the most value.

**Results:**
- 55% increase in marketing ROI
- Improved revenue while meeting business goals
- Enhanced marketing effectiveness across campaigns
- Optimized budget allocation across different platforms

**Implementation Approach:**
The bank used a data-driven approach to examine the relationship between marketing mix elements and performance measures such as sales and market share. This allowed them to determine the effectiveness of each marketing input and drive improvements in overall marketing effectiveness.

As the bank's Chief Marketing Officer noted: "The insights generated through MMM have transformed how we allocate our marketing budget, leading to significantly improved returns on our marketing investments."

## CPG Industry Applications and Case Studies

Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) companies were early adopters of MMM, and the approach continues to deliver value in this sector, especially as retail media networks and e-commerce have transformed the landscape.

### Case Study: Beyond Meat

Beyond Meat, a leading plant-based meat company, implemented MMM to better understand how their media and marketing investments were driving sales across brick-and-mortar retail distribution. According to an M-Squared case study, the company was particularly interested in understanding the effectiveness of their investments in Retail Media Networks (RMNs).

The analysis included media investment and delivery data across TV, social, audio, display, video, and RMNs, as well as retail sales information from various outlets ranging from big box stores to specialty retailers.

**Results:**
- Media drove nearly 10% of sales on an incremental basis
- Overall Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) of almost $4.00
- Significant variation in RMN performance: RMN A (ROAS 3.9), RMN B (ROAS 2.9), RMN C (ROAS 0.3)
- Upper-funnel tactics (ROAS 4.85) and lower-funnel tactics (ROAS 2.6) outperformed mid-funnel tactics
- Potential for 26% growth in retail sales driven by media with optimized budget allocation

**Implementation Approach:**
The company built four separate models for different retail channels to account for the unique dynamics of each. This approach allowed them to identify which media channels were most effective for each retail environment and optimize accordingly.

The VP of Marketing at Beyond Meat commented: "MMM has given us unprecedented visibility into how our marketing investments translate to sales across different retail environments, allowing us to make more informed decisions about our media mix."

## Insurance Industry Applications and Case Studies

Insurance companies face long sales cycles and complex customer journeys, making marketing measurement particularly challenging. MMM provides a structured approach to understanding marketing effectiveness in this environment.

### Case Study: Leading Insurance Brand

A significant player in the insurance sector implemented MMM to optimize its marketing ROI. According to a Quantzig case study, the company wanted to evaluate the impact of its marketing inputs to better allocate its budget and achieve its marketing objectives.

The analysis used SPSS software and LISREL with descriptive and inferential statistical methods to determine the relationship between marketing mix variables and brand equity. The approach differentiated between incremental drivers (price discounts, campaigns, promotions) and base drivers (brand value accumulated over time).

**Results:**
- 43% increase in ROI by directing marketing spend toward the correct variables
- Identified that brand image, propaganda, and promotion had higher impact on brand equity
- Enabled budget optimization by shifting marketing spend from low-performing to high-performing channels
- Established a long-term strategy for marketing activities based on data-backed analysis

**Implementation Approach:**
The company performed Pierson correlation tests, regression, and path analysis on collected data to determine the relationship between dependent and independent marketing mix variables. This allowed them to identify which elements of their marketing mix were most effective at building brand equity and driving sales.

The Chief Strategy Officer noted: "The insights from our MMM implementation have fundamentally changed how we think about marketing investment, shifting our focus from activities that intuitively seemed valuable to those that demonstrably drive business results."

## Common ROI Metrics and Benchmarks

Across industries, several key metrics are commonly used to measure the ROI of MMM implementations:

### Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)

ROAS measures the revenue generated for every dollar spent on advertising. Based on the case studies above, benchmark ROAS values typically range from:
- Low-performing channels: 0.3-1.0x
- Average-performing channels: 1.0-3.0x
- High-performing channels: 3.0-5.0x+

### Incremental Sales Lift

This measures the additional sales generated by marketing activities beyond what would have occurred naturally. Benchmarks include:
- CPG industry: 5-15% of total sales
- Retail industry: 10-20% of total sales
- Insurance industry: 15-25% of new policy sales

### Marketing Efficiency Ratio

This measures the ratio of marketing-driven profit to marketing cost. Typical benchmarks:
- Low efficiency: <1.0x
- Average efficiency: 1.0-2.0x
- High efficiency: >2.0x

### Budget Optimization Potential

This measures how much additional value could be generated by optimizing the marketing budget allocation without increasing total spend:
- Typical range: 10-30% improvement in marketing ROI

### Implementation ROI

This measures the return on investment in the MMM implementation itself:
- Typical range: 5-10x the cost of implementation within the first year

These benchmarks provide useful context, but it's important to note that results vary significantly based on industry, company size, marketing maturity, and implementation approach. Organizations should establish their own baseline metrics and track improvement over time rather than focusing solely on industry benchmarks.

By leveraging MMM, companies across retail, CPG, and insurance industries are achieving measurable improvements in marketing effectiveness and efficiency, driving significant business value through data-driven decision making.
